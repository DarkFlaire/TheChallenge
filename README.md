# TheChallenge
A challenge for a friend.

Welcome to the challenge. I've come to test your [skills.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxBVd3mMslQ) Complete as much or as little of the challenge as you can during the weekend, and push it up when you are finished.

##Rules
1. Complete the code to the best of your ability.
2. Use Google only if absolutely necessary.
3. Don't change the test cases. ![I can tell.](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/agentrockstar/images/c/cb/I'm_watching_you_meme_face.gif/revision/latest?cb=20130724195856 Don't try it.)
4. Don't use outside packages/imports.
5. Have fun with it!

###Part 1 - MVP
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to reverse a string. The MVP(Minimum Viable Product) here will take any string and return the absolute reverse of it - capitalization, spaces and special characters as well. (Example: "carrot" will be turned into "torrac").

###Stretch 1 - Refactor
After you complete part 1, refactor (see: improve) your code so that it minimizes runtime and data usage. In other words, if you created any variables in the course of writing the reverse method, see if you can improve the code so that it _doesn't_ create any extra variables.

###Stretch 2 - Getting complex
Should you finish the first stretch, try completing the second method, which is supposed to reverse the letters in the words of a multi-word string while keeping word order intact. (Example: "going on an adventure" will become "gniog no na erutnevda".)

###Stretch 3 - Advanced
Finally, complete the third method, which also keeps the placement of any special characters (exclamation points, periods, etc.) Reading up on [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/) might prove beneficial.


##Good luck!
